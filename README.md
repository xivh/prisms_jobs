prisms-jobs
===========

A Python package and set of scripts used for submitting and managing
cluster jobs via PBS (TORQUE) or Slurm.

This code is developed by the PRedictive Integrated Structural Materials Science Center (PRISMS), at the University of Michigan, which is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering under Award #DE-SC0008637, and the Van der Ven group, originally at the University of Michigan and
currently at the University of California Santa Barbara.


## Local Changes
- add PRISMS_JOBS_SOFTWARE environment variable that can be set to 'torque' or 'slurm' in case automatic detection fails
- set number of nodes manually with SLURM instead of allowing the queue manager to choose the number of nodes
- fix parsing/general support for SLURM

### TODO
- not all database entries are used, for example I don't think completiontime is ever set
- try to speed up pstat command
- documentation (PRISMS_JOB_SOFTWARE variable, jobstatus, taskstatus)

## Overview

When submitted through the ``prisms_jobs`` Python package or the included scripts,
cluster jobs are stored in a SQLite jobs database. This allows for convenient
monitoring and searching of submitted jobs.

It is often necessary to submit multiple jobs until a particular task is complete,
whether due to walltime or other limitations. ``prisms_jobs`` distinguishes and
tracks both individual "jobstatus" ('R', 'Q', 'C', 'E', etc.) and "taskstatus".
Jobs marked as 'auto' can be automatically or easily resubmitted until the
"taskstatus" is "Complete".

Possible values for "taskstatus" are:

| Taskstatus | Meaning                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|"Complete"  |Job and task are complete.                                   |
|"Incomplete"|Job or task are incomplete.                                  |
|"Continued" |Job is complete, but task was not complete.                  |
|"Check"     |Non-auto job is complete and requires user input for status. |
|"Error:.*"  |Some kind of error was noted.                                |
|"Aborted"   |The job and task have been aborted.                          |


Jobs are marked 'auto' either by submitting through the python class ``prisms_jobs.Job``
with the attribute ``auto=True``, or by submitting a script which contains
the line ``#auto=True`` using the included ``psub`` command line program.  

Jobs can be monitored using the command line program ``pstat``. All 'auto' jobs
which have stopped can be resubmitted using ``pstat --continue``. In this case,
'continuation_jobid' is set with the jobid for the next job in the series of jobs
comprising a task.

Example screen shot:

    $ pstat


    Tracked:
    JobID        JobName                  Nodes Procs     Walltime S      Runtime Task                     A ContJobID   
    ------------ ------------------------ ----- ----- ------------ - ------------ ------------------------ - ------------
    11791024     STDIN                      1     1     0:01:00:00 Q            - Incomplete               1 -           
    11791025     STDIN                      1     1     0:01:00:00 Q            - Incomplete               1 -           


    Untracked:
    JobID        JobName                  Nodes Procs     Walltime S      Runtime Task                     A ContJobID   
    ------------ ------------------------ ----- ----- ------------ - ------------ ------------------------ - ------------
    11791026     taskmaster                 1     1     0:01:00:00 W   0:01:00:00 Untracked                0 -           

Additionally, when scheduling periodic jobs is not allowed other ways, the
``taskmaster`` script can fully automate this process. ``taskmaster`` executes
``pstat --continue`` and then resubmits itself to execute again periodically.

A script marked 'auto' should check itself for completion and when reached execute
``pstat --complete $JOBID --force`` in bash, or ``prisms_jobs.complete_job()`` in Python. If an 'auto' job script does not set its taskstatus to "Complete" it may continue
to be resubmitted indefinitely.    

Jobs not marked 'auto' are shown with the status "Check" in ``pstat`` until the user
marks them as "Complete".
